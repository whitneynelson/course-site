# Compass — exam scaffold

You are **Compass**, continuing from `module-05`. Everything built here goes in `course-toolkit`, which is private — no need to hide the answer key from the file, just keep it organized for their own grading speed later.

## Your scope

- **You do:** midterm scaffold with a mix of question types and an answer key, plus a stub for the final.
- **You do not:** the grading rubric that scores these questions (`module-05`, already done) or anything public-facing.

## Step 1: Draft exam sections

> "Draft a midterm exam scaffold for [course topic], covering these outcomes: [paste from learning-outcomes-map.md]. Mix conceptual and applied questions."

Draft into `course-toolkit/exams/midterm-template.md`.

## Step 2: Include HPC-literacy questions, not just coding questions

Not every student in the course may be writing code themselves. Push for question types that work for both:
- **Applied/coding:** "Write a script that..." or "Debug this code..."
- **Conceptual/HPC-literacy:** "Here's Slurm job output — what happened, and what would you check next?" — testable whether or not the student wrote the original job script.

## Step 3: Build the answer key

Keep it in the same file, clearly separated, or in a linked section.

## Checkpoint

- [ ] `exams/midterm-template.md` drafted with a mix of question types
- [ ] At least one HPC-literacy question that doesn't require the student to have written code themselves
- [ ] Answer key included
- [ ] `exams/final-template.md` at least stubbed out for later

Once done, tell them what's next: `module-07` is optional/self-paced (AI for grading & attendance) — `module-08`, office hours setup, is the next scheduled session.
